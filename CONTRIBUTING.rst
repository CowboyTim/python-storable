Contribution Guide
==================


The project is maintained `on github <gh>`_ and uses the `the well known "nvie"
workflow <nvie>`_. As of version 1.0, version numbers follow `semantic
versioning <semver>`_.

Submitting Bug Reports & Feature Requests
-----------------------------------------

Please use the `github project <gh>`_ to submit any requests.


Branches & Pull Requests
========================

As per the `proposed workflow <nvie>`_, each feature should be implemented on a
feature branch. This also goes for anything related to pull-requests (even for
proposed bugfixes). Keeping each pull-request on a dedicated branch will make
merging much easier.


Unit Tests
==========

Organisation
------------

Important files/directories::

    test.pl            # Generates "storable" files.
    tests/
      |
      +-- resources/   # Contains the generated "storable" files.
      |
      +-- results/     # Contains the "expected" Python values.
      |
      +-- tests.py     # Finds and runs tests.


Unit tests are organised in the following way:

* *(only needed to test new data formats)* The file ``test.pl`` generates
  test-data. It writes the generated files into ``tests/resources`` adding
  subfolders for the used architecture and storable version.
* For each test-case generated by ``test.pl``, the corresponding "expected"
  value is contained in the folder ``tests/results``. The file has the same
  name as the storable file, except for a different extension.
* The test module ``tests/test.py`` contains the testing code. It searches for
  "storable" files and reconciles the conversion result with the content in the
  expetced Python files. This part is dynamic and need not be touched when
  adding new tests.

Writing/Modifying tests
-----------------------

In most cases the only thing needed is to create/modify the "expected" Python
files in ``tests/results``. The module only needs to provide a variable in its
global namespace called ``result``. The actual result from ``python-storable``
will be compared against that one. Looking at existing files may help.

Optionally, for more complex comparison cases, the module can contain a
function called ``is_equal`` taking two arguments (the storable result, and the
"expected" value). The function should return a boolean value with ``True``
meaning that both values are to be considered equal.


Running
-------

I highly recommend using ``pytest`` to run the tests. This has several reasons:

* Unit-tests are dynamically generated and there is no runner included. Pytest
  comes with it's own really useful runner.
* Depending on bug/error the console output becomes barely readable due to the
  sheer number of tests. ``pytest`` can help with better ``stout`` handling and
  ``--exitfirst``.
* ``pytest`` can easily limit the executed tests using ``-k``.

Example Command (assuming a virtualenv in ``./env``)::

    ./env/bin/pytest tests/test.py

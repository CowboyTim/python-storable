python-storable
===============

Overview
--------

This is a python module that will be able to read/write perl storable. Storable
is a nice and efficient binary format for perl that is very popular. Alot of
other serialization/deserialization modules exist that are even more or less
standardized: JSON, XML, CSV,.. etc. Storable is more or less perl specific.

To ease integration between perl -where storable sometimes is the only option-
and python this module is a bridge.
